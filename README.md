You should follow the [official documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/) about installing a Zola theme.  

I recommend adding the theme as a git submodule :  
```bash
cd my-zola-website
git submodule add -b main git@github.com:tchartron/zola-tailwind.git zola-tailwind
```
